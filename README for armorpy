To run the code, type           python armor.py

This program shows how to obtain highest value based on 300 currency.
Algorithm for Knapsack problem is applied to solve it. 
For every kind of armors, use greedy algorithm and dynamic programming to find the best choice at each step.
In order to have an extra armor, program is set to obtain five armors and the fifth armor can be one of four types.
For each choice of types, run the iterations and finally judge which choice of types reaches the maximum.
Since this program is not restricted to any parameter of inventory, other inventories can also use it.

After a hard fought battle with a particularly tough Werewolf, renowned Witcher Geralt of Rivia is in need of some new armor. Fortunately, there was a bounty for the recently defeated beast, and for his triumph Geralt has received a good bit of coin ( called Crowns ). Traveling to a nearby armorer, Geralt is faced with more options than he is used to. Given his funds, the Witcher needs to purchase an armor set with the highest possible total armor value.

Create a program that will determine the armor set of the highest value based on Geralt¡¯s available currency ( Crowns ). An armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type.

300 Crowns Available
You must be able to afford the total price of your armor set given your available Crowns
Each piece of armor contains a type, name, price, and armor value
Remember, an armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type
Inventory in Armorer¡¯s shop provided

Display the final answer.
Explain how you implemented the solution. Is your solution successful with other inventories?
